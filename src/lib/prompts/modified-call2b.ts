ARTISAN CUT FOR FILES

You will receive a file (PDF, image, text, code, spreadsheet, etc.) that I uploaded.

Apply the Artisan Cut to create a compressed file description.
You are a modern and powerful LLM model. Ask yourself: how can you describe this file in the fewest words possible such that ...

 - you keep everything that you could not infer back easily from fewer words.
 - you tightly condense everything that you could indeed infer back easily from fewer words.
  **Exception: Behavioral directives (HOW to act) are NOT easily inferable from role descriptions (WHAT you are)**
 - you remove everything that is honestly just noise.

Examples of information that you cannot infer back fully from fewer words:

- Business matters – decisions, negotiations, agreements, risks, numbers, timelines, financial data
- Strategic content – core thesis, unique insights, competitive analysis, action items
- Specific data – exact numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, dates, targets, metrics
- Key entities – people, companies, products, technologies mentioned
- Behavioral directives – HOW to act, not just WHAT you are
  - Tone modifiers: "powerful," "warm," "direct," "critical"
  - Behavioral adverbs: "critically evaluate" ≠ "evaluate"
  - Resource usage guidance: "wisely," "for your benefit," "truly help" (not just "use" or "help")
  - Addressing conventions: "call them Boss" ≠ "reports to Boss"
  - Communication style: "conversational" vs "formal" vs "irreverent"
  - Response patterns: "challenge assumptions" vs "support ideas"
  - Empowerment language: "give yourself permission" ≠ "permission to"
  - Interaction structure: "3-expert panel: Boss poses Qs, experts debate" ≠ "consultation" (HOW conversation flows)
  - Debate patterns: "Expert 2 rejects Expert 1 proposal" (contrarian thinking valued, not consensus)
- Critical decisions – what was chosen, rejected, why
- Terminology – exact phrasing of important statements, defined terms, branded concepts
- Emotional/psychological weight – shame, fear, self-rejection, urgency (context for future motivation)

Examples of information that you can easily infer back fully from fewer words:

- Generic descriptions that can be reduced to semantic labels
- Background context or widely known information
- Step-by-step explanations unless tied to strategic decisions
- Verbose prose that can be condensed to telegraphic form

Examples of information that is just pure noise:

- Qualifiers like "approximately," "roughly," "about," "seems like"
- Grammatical fillers and unnecessary transitions
- Meta-commentary like "This document contains..." or "The file shows..."
- Repetitions of information

Use punctuation symbols . , ; : - etc. heavily in generating your artisan cuts.

## Output Format

Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:

{
  "filename": "[exact filename including extension]",
  "file_type": "[image|pdf|text|code|spreadsheet|other]",
  "description": "[your artisan cut compressed description here]"
}
</earlier-instruction-set>

<new-instruction-set>

I'm giving you back your response. Improve it. Don't mention that you are doing a review. Since I will only use this improved response make it sound like it is the official one.

Is the filename exact and correct?
Is the file_type accurate?
Is the description well crafted? Would you be able to regenerate the file's key content from this compressed description?
Did you preserve everything that cannot be inferred back easily?
Did you condense everything that can be inferred back easily?
Did you remove pure noise?
